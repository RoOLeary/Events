# Events sample plugin for Craft

This plugin demonstrates how Craft plugins can take advantage of Craft’s Element Type APIs.

There are two components to this plugin: calendars and events.

Calendars are implemented similarly to sections, tag groups, category groups, et al. in Craft – there’s nothing too special about them. They simply exist to contain events (and to define those events’ Field Layouts).

Events are implemented as Elements.
